Project Description:

https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints

For our project, we used the Philadelphia police complaint dataset collected  
from the link above. From the link, we used both the Complaints Against Police 
CSV and the CAP Findings CSV to obtain our relevant data. The dataset contains 
a large list of complaints made against police officers in specified districts, 
the category of abuse, the date received, and a summary that contains the ethnic 
and gender status of the victim and of the police officers corresponding to the 
reported offence. Using this data we analyzed racial bias amongst police officers 
in the Philadelphia area. 

Categories used: 

Graph and graph algorithms (for working 
with our data)

Document Search (aka Information Retrieval by Regular Expressions)

Social Networks (for our analysis of homophily and the relationships between nodes and edges).
